        <p class="card-text"> Dr Pepper's unique, sparkling blend of 23 fruit flavours has been around for well over
            a century amd it's still the same, with that distinctive flavour you just can't quite put your toungue on.
            It was created by Texas pharmacist Charles Alderton in 1885. Hw gave a sample of the first ever batch to
            Wade Morrison, a local shop owner, and Mr Morrison instantly agreed to stock the drink. The distinctive,
            bold taste of Dr Pepper has been popular ever since. </p>
