                <p class="card-text">Atlanta Beginners: It was 1886, and in New York Harbour, workers were constructing
                    the
                    Statue of Liberty. Eight hundred miles away, another great American symbol was about to be unveiled.
                    Like many people who change history, John Pemberton, an Atlanta pharmacist, was inspired by simple
                    curiosity. One afternoon, he stirred up a fragrant, caramel-coloured liquid and, when it was done,
                    he
                    carried it a few doors down to Jacobs Pharmacy. Here, the mixture was combined with carbonated
                    water and
                    sampled by customers who all agreed
                    - this new drink was something special.
                    So, Jacobs Pharmacy put it on sale for five cents (about 3p) a glass.</p>
